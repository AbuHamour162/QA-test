In this code first I load the base image and launch the web driver to navigate to the website where the image is located.
second find the image element using Selenium's findElement method and get the image URL. 
Then we download the image to a file using Java's URLConnection class or a similar library.
After downloading the image, we load it as a BufferedImage and compare it to the base image using the same method as the previous example code. 
Finally, I used the assertEquals method from JUnit to verify that pixelDiff is 0, meaning that there are no differences between the two images.
