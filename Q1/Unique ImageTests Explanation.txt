In this code  first I launch the web driver and navigate to the website where the image is located.
second I find the image element using Selenium's findElement method and get the image URL. 
Then I called the isImageUnique method to download the image and check if it's unique.
The isImageUnique method downloads the image to a temporary file using Java's URLConnection class, and then compares it to previously downloaded images. 
The previous images are assumed to be stored in a directory called "images" in the same directory as the Java code. 
If the downloaded image is identical to any of the previous images, the method returns false.
 Otherwise, the method moves the temporary file to the "images" directory and returns true.
