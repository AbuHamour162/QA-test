The code first takes a directory path as input, and creates a File object to represent the directory.
It then loops through all the files in the directory, and checks if each file has a " .csv  "extension.
For each CSV file, it creates a BufferedReader to read the file line by line.
It reads the first line of the file (which should contain the header row) and checks that it contains the expected column names ("name" and "id").
It then reads each subsequent line of the file and performs the following checks:
Checks that the line contains at least two fields.
Checks that the "name" field is not empty.
Checks that the "name" field only contains letters (i.e., is a string).
Adds the "name" field to a Set to check for duplicates.
Adds the "id" field to a Set to check for uniqueness.
If any errors are encountered, the program outputs a message describing the error and moves on to the next file.
If no errors are encountered, the program moves on to the next file.
